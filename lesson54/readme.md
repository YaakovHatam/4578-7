# install

## First step
Install Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) globally in our computer so we can use CLI everywhere `npm i @angular/cli -g`

Create new app with `ng new PROJECT_NAME` CLI command, for ex: `ng new student-app`

Run the application (dont forget to navigate with `cd` to your new app directory): `ng serve -o`

## Creating Component
Create new component: `ng generate component COMPONENT_NAME`
